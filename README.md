🐱🐶 Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) 🧠

📖 Overview

This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The goal is to classify images of cats 🐱 and dogs 🐶 into their respective categories. The project leverages TensorFlow and Keras to build, train, and evaluate the CNN model. Additionally, it includes methods for visualizing the model's predictions and understanding its focus through Class Activation Maps (CAM) 🔍.

🛠 Project Description

The primary aim of this project is to build an image classification model that can accurately differentiate between images of cats 🐱 and dogs 🐶. The project encompasses the entire workflow from data preparation to model evaluation and visualization.

Key features of this project include:

Data Preprocessing: Rescaling and augmentation to enhance model generalization 🔄.

CNN Model: Building a model with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers 🏗️.

Model Evaluation: Using various metrics to assess performance 📊.

📈 Data Preparation

The dataset consists of images of cats 🐱 and dogs 🐶, organized into training and test sets. 
The data preparation involves:

Rescaling: Normalizing pixel values to a range of [0, 1] to improve model performance 🌟.

Augmentation: Applying transformations such as shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping to increase the diversity of the training data 🔄.

The dataset is divided into:

Training Set: 2000 images 📷

Test Set: 624 images 📷

Images are resized to 64x64 pixels to standardize input size for the CNN 🖼️.

🏗️ Model Architecture

The CNN model is designed to capture spatial hierarchies in images through the following layers:

Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the images 🔍.

Pooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions and computational complexity 📉.

Fully Connected Layers: Perform the classification based on extracted features 🔗.

Activation Functions: Use ReLU for hidden layers and Sigmoid for the output layer to perform binary classification ⚙️.

🏋️ Training and Evaluation

The model is trained using the training set and validated on the test set.

Key aspects include:

Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy, suitable for binary classification tasks 💔.

Optimizer: Adam optimizer for efficient gradient descent ⚙️.

Metrics: Accuracy and loss are tracked to evaluate model performance 📊.

📊 Visualization Techniques - Performance Metrics

Confusion Matrix: Provides a comprehensive view of model performance, showing the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.

ROC Curve: Illustrates the trade-off between the True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR), offering insight into the model's ability to discriminate between classes.

Precision-Recall Curve: Focuses on the precision and recall of the model, especially useful for imbalanced datasets to understand how well the model identifies positive instances.
